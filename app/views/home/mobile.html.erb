          <p>Dot Bot is a brand new game that pits your mental prowess, finger stamina, and visual acuity against one of the mightiest of geometrical objects, Dots. Thatâ€™s right Dots. Are you up for the challenge? Or are you wimping out now? If you don't take on the challenge consider yourself already bested by the simple Dot!</p>
		  
		  <p>This version comes with two game modes, Scatter and Classic:</p>

		  <p>Scatter Mode - Get all 50 dots in as quick of time as possible. Touch each dot in order starting from dot #1. DO NOT go out of order and DO NOT touch the white background.</p>

		  <p>Classic mode - Get as many dots as you can in 30 seconds. Touch a dot and a new one appears instantly somewhere else on the screen. DO NOT touch the white background.</p>
